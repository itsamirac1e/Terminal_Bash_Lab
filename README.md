<h1>Linux Terminal Lab - "A High-Stakes Investigation"</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this Linux lab, as a security analyst for Lucky Duck Casino, the objective was to investigate and mitigate significant losses at the roulette tables on March 10, 12, and 15. Suspecting collusion between a player and a dealer, I utilized command-line skills to navigate, modify, and analyze the casino's database. The goal was to swiftly identify the rogue duo and prepare evidence files for potential prosecution, given the casino's financial constraints. The urgent findings were summarized for Lucky Duck's management, aiming to expose and prevent further fraudulent activities.
